The notebook includes the following exercises:

1. **Initial dataset exploration**  
2. **Basic statistical analysis**  
3. **Grouping and comparisons**  
4. **Conditionals and filtering**  
5. **Basic statistics and probability**  
6. **Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib**  
7. **Extra exercises**
